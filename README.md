## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains several projects focusing on neural network models and data analysis. The main datasets include:
- **Walmart sales data** for time series forecasting.
- **Customer churn data** for predicting customer retention using machine learning models.

The projects are divided into Jupyter notebooks that walk through the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps.

```

## 🔍 Project Details
🧠 Neural Networks on Customer Churn 
In these notebooks, we build and train neural network models to predict customer churn. The approach includes: <br>
Data preprocessing and feature scaling. <br>
Implementing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using TensorFlow. <br>
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. <br>

🏪 Walmart Sales Forecasting
In this part of the project, we use time series analysis on Walmart's sales data. The steps include: <br>
Data cleaning and handling missing values. <br> 
Implementing an ARIMA model to forecast sales. <br>
Comparing different windowing techniques (Expanding vs Sliding Window). <br>

🚀 How to Run: <br>
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Neural-Networks-Data-Analysis.git
```
Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd Neural-Networks-Data-Analysis
```
Open the Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook NeuralNetworks_Cau1.ipynb
```
Ensure the datasets Walmart.csv and Customer_Churn_01.csv are in the same directory as the notebooks.
